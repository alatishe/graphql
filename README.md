# Next.js & Apollo GraphQL Server-Side Rendering

The [recommended Apollo method for Server-Side Rendering in Next.js](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/next-js/next-js-getting-started/) involves duplicating queries, separate code for server and client, and a bunch of added complications.

This approach uses built-in methods from Next.js and Apollo to server-side render GraphQL queries.
